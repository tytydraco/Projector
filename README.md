# Projector
A JetBrains Projector client for Android devices!

# JetBrains Projector
JetBrains has created a very neat program that allows Swing applications to be accessed using a web browser. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/JetBrains/projector-installer).

# Benefits
While one can access the JetBrains Projector server from any web browser, the Android Projector application serves various benefits:

- Saved address and port
- Immersive experience (no address bar, navigation bar, or status bar)
- Free and open source
- Extremely compact and universal

# Usage
Under the `Address` field, put an IP address or a URL. For example, one could be hosted at `192.168.0.21`. Under the `Port` field, put the port that the JetBrains Projector installer specified. For the `Secure connection` field, the server must be setup to use the `https://` protocol.
